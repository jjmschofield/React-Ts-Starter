# React Typescript Starter
## Overview
This repo provides an opinionated template for getting up and running with React and Typescript quickly.

## Getting Started
```
$ npm install
...
$ npm start
```

## Build
```
$ npm run build
```

## Unit Test
```
$ npm test
```
This will by default run tests with a watch.

By default `Jest` will only run tests which have changed or may be impacted by a change since the last commit.

To run all tests do:
```
$ npm test a
```

To run all tests without a watch do:
```
$ npm run ci:test
```

## Opinions
### `npm` and not `yarn`
Why?
* The two have become very close in terms of functionality
* There is no known benefit at this point not to use the standard node pacakge manager

### Platform Agnostic
This starter is intended to run on any OS capable of running node.

### BYOIDE
It should be possible to execute all key functionality from the command line, and commonly used standards and tools are 
employed to provide as consistent a development experience across IDE's as possible.

### Webstorm Support
Webstorm is a fantastic IDE once learned which includes killer features such as simplified and safe reactors as well 
as in IDE coverage and test runners.

### VS Code Support (help needed)
VS Code is also awesome, and a pull request to add some solid VS Code defaults would be very welcome.

## Notes
### Create React App
This project was originally generated by `create-react-app` and makes use of `react-scripts-ts`.

The original [README.md](CREATE_REACT_README.md) has been preserved.
